## Running the web version
To start the web version from command line, run

```
./gradlew :web:run
```

This will start a development server on your machine where you can test the app. 
If you need to access the server from other devices, you can specify a binding address

```
./gradlew :web:run -Pgbind=A.B.C.D
```

where `A.B.C.D` is your IP address. 
Then you can access the dev server through `http://A.B.C.D:8888`.
You can also run `./gradlew :web:tasks` to list other options.

## Running the desktop version (Classic 5)
To start the desktop version from command line, run

```
./gradlew :desktop:run
